# Proposal notes

Dated notes on questions that touch `docs/PROPOSAL.md`, which is frozen. Each note records a decision or an open
question for the author; the proposal text itself does not change.

## 2026-09-08 — agentgateway ingress and egress under agentgateway's own control plane

Decision by the author. Gate 1 placed agentgateway on the path only as an Istio ambient waypoint driven by istiod
(the integration the proposal's §4.4 C describes, where agentgateway proxies are configured through Gateway API
resources alone). From step 2b on, two further agentgateway proxies are added under agentgateway's own control
plane (Helm charts `agentgateway-crds` and `agentgateway`, GatewayClass `agentgateway`), following the
agentgateway documentation's Istio ambient integration pages:

- an ingress gateway in front of Agent A (the client entry point), and
- an egress waypoint between Agent B and the model endpoint, with the model host modelled as an external
  destination through an Istio ServiceEntry, as those pages prescribe for an LLM provider.

Consequences the author accepts: (1) the topology gains two hops, `client → ingress → Agent A → waypoint →
Agent B → egress → model`; every baseline claim through the new hops needs its own recorded count (step 2b);
(2) Experiment C's premise widens: the proxies under agentgateway's own control plane can receive
agentgateway-native policy resources, which the istiod-driven waypoint cannot, so C's map of "what each layer
can distinguish" must state which control plane drives each hop; (3) one more pin, the agentgateway control
plane chart version, recorded in `versions.yaml`. The istiod-driven waypoint stays as the measured layer between
the two agents. The proposal text is unchanged.
